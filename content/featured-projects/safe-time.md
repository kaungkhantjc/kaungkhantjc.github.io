Safe Time is a highly customizable Kotlin library that can be used to get time from [NTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) servers. It should work on JVM-based multiplatform projects including Android.

## Why Safe Time?

If users manually adjust their clocks, `System.currentTimeMillis()` may reflect these changes, leading to unreliable timestamps. Safe Time library ensures a consistent, unaffected time source for your app.

## Download

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.kaungkhantjc/safeTime-core)

For Android using Gradle

```gradle
implementation("io.github.kaungkhantjc:safeTime-android:1.0.1")
```

For JVM-based multiplatform projects using Gradle

```gradle
implementation("io.github.kaungkhantjc:safeTime-core:1.0.1")
```

[SafeTime jar downloads](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/kaungkhantjc/safeTime-core/1.0.1) are available from [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.kaungkhantjc/safeTime-core/overview).

## Usage

Create SafeTime instance in application class and sync time once app starts.

```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    val safeTime by lazy {
        SafeTime.Builder()
            .setNTPHosts("time.android.com", "time.google.com")
            .elapsedTimeAPI { SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() }
            .build()
    }

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        safeTime.sync()
    }

}
```

Then we can use like this. We can also use [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) to inject SafeTime instance.

```kotlin
val safeTime = (application as? App)?.safeTime
```

### SafeTime instance functions

- now()

  Retrieves the current timestamp based on cached time. It throws `SafeTimeException` if the cached time is invalid.

    ```kotlin
    val currentTimestamp = safeTime.now()
    ```

- nowOrSync(...)

  Retrieves the current timestamp using cached time or synchronizes with NTP servers.

    ```kotlin
    safeTime.nowOrSync(object: SafeTimeListener {
        override fun onSuccessful(safeTimeInfo: SafeTimeInfo) {
            val currentTimestamp = safeTimeInfo.timestamp
        }
    })
    ```

  We can also use lifecycle-aware coroutine scope for automatic cancellation.

    ```kotlin
    safeTime.nowOrSync(lifecycleScope, safeTimeListener)
    ```

- nowOrElse(...)

  Retrieves the current timestamp from cached time or returns the provided default value

    ```kotlin
    val currentTimestamp = safeTime.nowOrElse { System.currentTimeMillis() }
    ```

- nowOrDefault()

  Retrieves the current timestamp from cached time or the device's `System.currentTimeMillis()` if the cached time is invalid.

    ```kotlin
    val currentTimestamp = safeTime.nowOrDefault()
    ```

- cancel()

  Cancels the synchronization job

    ```kotlin
    safeTime.cancel()
    ```

- sync()

  Synchronizes time with NTP servers. This function checks the validity of the cached time using SafeTimeCache. If the cached time is valid, the synchronization process is skipped.

    ```kotlin
    safeTime.sync()
    ```

- sync(listener)

  Immediately synchronizes time with NTP servers, ignoring cached time.

    ```kotlin
    safeTime.sync(object: SafeTimeListener {
        override fun onSuccessful(safeTimeInfo: SafeTimeInfo) {
            val currentTimestamp = safeTimeInfo.timestamp
        }
    })
    ```

### SafeTime.Builder functions

```kotlin
val safeTime = SafeTime.Builder()
    .setNTPHosts("time.android.com", "time.google.com")
    .addNTPHost("time.aws.com")
    .elapsedTimeAPI { SystemClock.elapsedRealtime() }
    .syncDispatcher(Dispatchers.IO)
    .listenerDispatcher(Dispatchers.Main)
    .setListener(safeTimeListener)
    .cache(PreferenceSafeTimeCache(this))
    .connectionTimeout(3.seconds)
    .maxRetryPerHost(0)
    .maxRetryLoop(0)
    .delayBetweenRetryLoop(0.seconds)
    .rootDelayMax(100)
    .rootDispersionMax(100)
    .serverResponseDelayMax(750.milliseconds)
    .build()
```

## How it works?

Safe Time uses [NTPUDPClient](https://github.com/apache/commons-net/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/net/ntp/NTPUDPClient.java) from Apache Commons Net to sync time from NTP servers. More information can be found on the [Apache Commons Net homepage](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net).

For correct time calculation, Safe Time uses [Clock synchronization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol#Clock_synchronization_algorithm).

>correct time = response time + clock offset

Response time is calculated like this.

> response time = request time + (response ticks - request ticks)

- request time is obtained from `System.currentTimeMillis()` before NTPUDPClient call is made.
- request ticks is obtained from `System.currentTimeMillis()` (`SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` in Android) before NTPUDPClient call is made.
- response ticks is obtained from `System.currentTimeMillis()` (`SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` in Android) after NTPUDPClient call is made.

> The extent of the clock offset θ is directly proportional to the discrepancy between real-time and response time.

To calculates the clock offset θ, we need:

- originate time t0
- receive time t1
- transmit time t2
- response time t3

t0, t1 and t2 are obtained from Apache Commons Net library.

![clock offset θ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9a9ff4428ee0102d2c62b260df1b38b26989b383)

clock offset θ = ((t1 - t0) + (t2 - t3)) / 2
